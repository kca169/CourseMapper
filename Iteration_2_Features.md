# List of CourseMapper Features

## Features Implemented

#### Manual Course Input

- Admins can now input courses manually into the database
- Used when new courses are created or old ones updated


#### Tree Mode

- Shows all prerequisites for a certain course
- Including prerequisites for prerequisites


#### User Course Input

- Users can input courses they have already done (both manually and by uploading a pdf)
- This will be used to show if they meet the prerequisites for the course in the next iteration


### Features Planned for Future Iterations

#### SFU Academic API Parser - Tree Diagram/Directions Mode

- Need to make display better for both
- Also include if they have met completed prerequisites

#### Directions mode and the Tree diagram will then only show courses that the student still needs to complete
